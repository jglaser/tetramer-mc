//! Apply the Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation method to systems of bodies.
//!
//! `hoomd-mc` provides building blocks that you can use to create a Monte Carlo
//! simulation model. Start with a [`Microstate`] to represent
//! the properties of all the bodies and sites. Form a Hamiltonian using
//! types from [`hoomd_interaction`] that implement [`TotalEnergy`], [`DeltaEnergyOne`],
//! [`DeltaEnergyInsert`], and/or [`DeltaEnergyRemove`] and set the macrostate
//! using one of the types from [`hoomd_simulation`].
//!
//! [`Microstate`]: hoomd_microstate::Microstate
//! [`DeltaEnergyOne`]: hoomd_interaction::DeltaEnergyOne
//! [`DeltaEnergyInsert`]: hoomd_interaction::DeltaEnergyInsert
//! [`DeltaEnergyRemove`]: hoomd_interaction::DeltaEnergyRemove
//! [`TotalEnergy`]: hoomd_interaction::TotalEnergy
//!
//! # Trial moves
//!
//! The [`Trial`] trait describes a type that performs trial moves on a microstate.
//! [`Trial::apply`] takes a mutable microstate, the Hamiltonian, and the macrostate.
//! It attempts one or more trial moves, modifies the microstate with those that are
//! accepted, and returns a [`Count`] of the accepted and rejected moves.
//!
//! ## Local trial moves
//!
//! The [`LocalTrial`] trait describes a type that proposes trial moves as
//! small perturbations of the body properties. `hoomd-mc` implements
//! [`Translate`] and [`Rotate`] which propose moves that translate the body's
//! position and rotate the body's orientation, respectively. You can implement
//! a custom [`LocalTrial`] as needed in your simulation model.
//!
//! [`Sweep`] implements [`Trial`] by applying the given [`LocalTrial`] to every
//! body in the microstate. [`ParallelSweep`] does the same, but it executes many
//! trial moves in parallel to increase performance. [`Sweep`] is very general and
//! will work with any boundary condition and local trial move, even when the move
//! is not actually confined to a small region in space and when all bodies interact
//! with all other bodies. [`ParallelSweep`] works only with boundaries that can be
//! covered ([`Cover`]) with a [`Checkerboard`] and when there is a hard cutoff
//! distance beyond which any two bodies cannot interact.
//!
//! ## Global trial moves
//!
//! A future release of *hoomd-rs* will implement moves that apply to the
//! simulation boundary.
//!
//! ## Body insertion/removal
//!
//! [`GrandCanonical`] randomly inserts and removes bodies from the microstate,
//! holding the system at constant chemical potential, volume, and temperature
//! ($` \mu, V, T`$).
//!
//! ## Tuning trial moves
//!
//! Most trial moves have tunable parameters. Typical simulation protocols
//! adjust these parameters to achieve a 20% acceptance rate. Trial moves
//! that implement the [`Tune`] trait can automatically [`Adjust`] the move
//! sizes to achieve the target.
//!
//! # Algorithms
//!
//! `hoomd-mc` also implements a number of MC-adjacent *algorithms*. They are
//! **not** trial moves (and therefore do not implement [`Trial`]) because they
//! describe non-reversible processes or otherwise do not obey detailed balance.
//! These algorithms are useful because they can achieve certain goals much faster
//! than an equilibrium simulation can.
//!
//! [`QuickInsert`] inserts bodies randomly drawn from the given distribution.
//! The [`UniformIn`] distribution randomly places a template body anywhere
//! in the simulation boundary. You could write your own distribution for custom
//! behavior. [`QuickCompress`] compresses the simulation boundary until it
//! reaches a target volume.
//!
//! # Complete documentation
