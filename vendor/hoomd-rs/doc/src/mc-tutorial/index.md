# Monte Carlo Tutorial

The [`hoomd-mc`] crate implements Monte Carlo simulations.

In a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, you chose the Hamiltonian ($`H`$) and what types
of trial moves to propose. *hoomd-rs* will:
1. Propose random trial moves that change the microstate: $`S \rightarrow S^\prime`$.
2. Compute the change in energy made by each trial move: $`\Delta E = H(S^\prime) - H(S)`$.
3. Then *accept* or *reject* the trial move based on criteria specific to that
   trial move.

For each of these steps, you can use built-in types provided by [`hoomd-mc`] or
write your own. Read the following tutorials to learn how to run and customize
MC simulations using *hoomd-rs*.
