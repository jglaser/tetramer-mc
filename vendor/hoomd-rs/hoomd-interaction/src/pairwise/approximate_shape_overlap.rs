/// Apply an isotropic potential evaluated at the approximate signed overlap distance.
///
/// Use [`ApproximateShapeOverlap`] combined with [`OverlapPenalty`] and
/// `QuickInsert` to quickly insert new bodies into the microstate or
/// `QuickCompress` to quickly compress the system to a target density.
/// In both cases, [`ApproximateShapeOverlap`] will allow partial overlaps
/// that can be resolved by later trial moves.
///
/// [`ApproximateShapeOverlap`] approximates the distance `r` that shape j
/// must be moved to remove any overlaps. If the shapes are already separate,
/// `r` is 0. Then it returns `isotropic.energy(-r)`. `resolution` sets the
/// steps between `r` values.
///
/// The overlap distance is *approximate* and expensive to evaluate. Do not
/// use this potential for equilibration or sampling. It is suitable *only*
/// for use during a brief initialization phase when `QuickInsert` is adding
/// bodies or `QuickCompress` is compressing the system.
