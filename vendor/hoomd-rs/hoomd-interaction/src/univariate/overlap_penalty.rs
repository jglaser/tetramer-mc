/// Monotonically non-decreasing potential to push sites apart (*not differentiable*).
///
/// [`OverlapPenalty`] is specifically designed to work with the `QuickInsert`
/// and `QuickCompress` algorithms to quickly prepare states with non-overlapping
/// particles. Combine it with [`ApproximateShapeOverlap`] to compute an energy that
/// penalizes hard particle overlaps.
///
/// The potential has three regions:
/// ```math
/// U(r) = \begin{cases}
/// \infty & r < -d_\mathrm{max} \\
/// \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \varepsilon_\mathrm{shoulder} & r < 0 \\
/// 0 & r \ge 0
/// \end{cases}
/// ```
/// The first region describes a completely hard interaction when sites overlap
/// too far. This prevents `QuickInsert` from creating too much strain with an
/// insertion. The second part applies a harmonic potential that allows trial moves
/// to gradually resolve overlaps. In the third region, sites are allowed to move
/// freely when not overlapping. The shoulder potential prevents trial moves from
/// creating new overlaps.
///
/// [`ApproximateShapeOverlap`]: crate::pairwise::ApproximateShapeOverlap
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use hoomd_interaction::univariate::OverlapPenalty;
///
/// let overlap_penalty = OverlapPenalty::default();
/// ```
