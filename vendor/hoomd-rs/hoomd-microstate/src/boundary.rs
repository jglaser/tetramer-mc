//! Traits that describe boundary conditions and a selection of types that implement them.
//!
//! See the [crate-level documentation](crate) for an overview of how boundary
//! conditions interact with [`Microstate`](crate::Microstate) and model methods.
//!
//! *hoomd-rs* provides the boundary types [`Open`], [`Closed`], and [`Periodic`].
//! * [`Open`] boundaries allow bodies and sites to exist anywhere in space.
//! * [`Closed`] boundaries limit bodies and sites to the inside of a shape and
//!   are not periodic in any direction.
//! * [`Periodic`] boundaries limit bodies and sites to the inside of a shape,
//!   wrap particles anywhere outside that shape back inside, and place ghosts
//!   following the periodic tiling of the shape.
//!
//! The documentation of [`Closed`] and [`Periodic`] describes the shapes that
//! they each implement. If the shape you want is not supported, you can write
//! a custom shape type and implement `IsInside` so that it will work with
//! [`Closed`]. To implement a custom periodic boundary, create your custom
//! type and implement both [`Wrap`] and [`GenerateGhosts`] for it.
