# Workflow Tutorial

By now, you have learned how to implement your simulation model using *hoomd-rs*
and have been able to run several test cases. Changing `main.rs` and
executing `cargo run` for each simulation is not very practical when your
research study will require tens, hundreds, or thousands of different
simulations. [Row] and [signac] can help you with that. The [hoomd-workspace]
crate implements a minimal Rust interface for [signac].

This tutorial assumes that you already have a basic understanding of [row] and
[signac]. If you don't, you should read their tutorials first. Here, you will
learn the best practices to integrate your *hoomd-rs* simulations with [row]
and [signac] including:

* Adding state points to the workspace.
* Reading the simulation parameters from a [signac] state point.
* Writing status messages to `stdout` using the [log] crate.
* Writing simulation trajectories to a [gsd] file.
* Logging properties of the simulation to [parquet] file(s).
* Serializing the simulation state to a file and deserializing that file to
  continue running it in a later job submission.
* Managing eligible, submitted, and completed state points with [row].

As such, this tutorial is broader in scope than the previous. The example is
not a single file, but a whole Git repository. The repository is a template,
designed to be altered for your own needs. As such, *don't clone*
or *fork* the repository (you don't need the template's commit history). You can
create your own new repository on GitHub [from the template] (and then clone
your own repository) or you can [download the template] for use locally.

Once you have a local copy, launch a terminal, change to that directory,
and you build the workflow binary with:
```shell
$ cargo build --release
```

Then you can run the binary `target/release/action`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You *must rerun* `cargo build --release` any time you change one of your
> `.rs` files. Unlike scripted languages you might be familiar with,
> Rust code must be compiled before it can be executed.

> [!NOTE]
> Previous tutorials demonstrated the use of `cargo run` to both **build** *and*
> **execute** the binary. This is a problem on HPC platforms where compute nodes
> may not have the network access needed to build and many parallel builds might
> conflict.

You need to install [row] to execute the sample workflow. To do so, execute
```
$ cargo install row
```
or use your preferred conda-forge compatible package manager.
