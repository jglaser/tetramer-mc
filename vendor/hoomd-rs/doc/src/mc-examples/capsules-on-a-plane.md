## Overview

* Objective: Self-assemble 3D capsules that are allowed to freely rotate while their
  center is confined to a 2D plane.
* File: `hoomd-rs/examples/mc-examples/capsules-on-a-plane.rs`
* Run (interactively):
  ```shell
  cargo run --release --features "bevy" --example capsules-on-a-plane
  ```
* Run (in batch mode):
  ```shell
  cargo run --release --example capsules-on-a-plane
  ```

## Strategy

1. Represent bodies with `Cartesian<2>` positions and `Versor` orientations.
2. Define a custom `SiteProperties` with `Cartesian<3>` positions and `Versor`
   orientations. Transform sites from the body frame to the simulation frame by first
   lifting the body position into 3D: `(body_x, body_y, 0)` and then transforming
   as normal.
3. Define a custom `Boundary` type that wraps `Periodic<Rectangle>`.
   Implement `Wrap<BodyProperties>`, `Volume`, `MapPoint`, `Scale`, and `Distribution`
   for the custom boundary by calling the same methods on the inner type.
   Implement `Wrap<SiteProperties>` and `GenerateGhosts` by projecting
   the 3D site position into 2D, calling the same methods on the wrapped type,
   then lift the result back into 3D.

See the example code for details. It implements all of these steps in a general fashion.
You can copy and paste this code and use it for Monte Carlo simulations with any 3D
interaction model (including multi-site rigid bodies) where the body centers should
be confined to the _xy_ plane.
