/// Computes energy as a function of one variable.
///
/// A univariate energy is function only of one variable. Often, this is
/// distance between two points: $`U(r)`$, but it could be a distance from a
/// point to a surface, or any other single variable.
///
/// Implement [`UnivariateEnergy`] on a custom type or use one of the provided
/// potentials in [`univariate`] in MD or MC simulations.
///
/// * Use [`UnivariateEnergy`] in combination with [`Isotropic`] and
///   [`PairwiseCutoff`] to model pairwise interactions between sites.
///
/// [`univariate`]: crate::univariate
/// [`Isotropic`]: crate::pairwise::Isotropic
/// [`PairwiseCutoff`]: crate::PairwiseCutoff
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Set a custom potential using a closure:
/// ```
/// use hoomd_interaction::univariate::UnivariateEnergy;
///
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// let a = 2.0;
/// let custom = |r: f64| a / (r.powi(12));
///
/// let energy = custom.energy(1.0);
/// assert_eq!(energy, 2.0);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Implement a custom potential via a type:
/// ```
/// use hoomd_interaction::univariate::UnivariateEnergy;
///
/// struct Custom {
///     a: f64,
