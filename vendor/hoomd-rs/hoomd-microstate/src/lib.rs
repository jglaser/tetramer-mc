//! Store and manage the simulation state.
//!
//! # Microstate
//!
//! [`Microstate`] facilitates simulations of particle systems. It is the central
//! data structure used by MC, MD, and supporting calculations implemented in
//! `hoomd-rs`. [`Microstate`] holds a set of bodies that exist in a space defined
//! by the boundary conditions. The degrees of freedom consist of the properties of
//! the bodies and the parameters of the boundary conditions.
//!
//! [`Microstate`] also stores many auxiliary data structures and implements
//! convenience methods to facilitate the efficient implementation of simulation
//! models. These include a set of all interaction sites in the system frame
//! of reference, ghost sites near the periodic boundaries, and spatial data
//! structures.
//!
//! ## Step, substep and seed
//!
//! [`Microstate`] tracks the current simulation step ([`Microstate::step`]),
//! substep ([`Microstate::substep`]), and seed ([`Microstate::seed`])
//! that allow models to generate uncorrelated random number streams via
//! [`Microstate::counter`].
//!
//! The **step** is the current step in the simulation as defined by the user.
//! For example, a single step could be one MD timestep or the application
//! of a set of MC moves. Users should call [`Microstate::increment_step`]
//! after each step in the model is completed. The **substep** is a running
//! counter tracking the number of operations called so far during the current
//! step. Model methods in *hoomd-rs* (such as the MC trial move `apply`) call
//! [`increment_substep`](Microstate::increment_substep) internally. Users should
//! call it at the end of any custom methods that implement new substeps.
//! A failure to call [`increment_substep`](Microstate::increment_substep)
//! will cause the reuse of the same random numbers from one substep to the next!**
//!
//! The **seed** allows users to select independent random number streams for
//! simulations that would otherwise be identical. It may only be set once on
//! creation by [`MicrostateBuilder::seed`].
//!
//! ## Bodies and sites
//!
//! [`Microstate`] differentiates between the degrees of freedom of the system and
//! points where interactions take place. Each [`Body`] in the microstate has one
//! or more interaction sites ([`Site`]). The bodies have degrees of freedom that
//! are evolved by the simulation model, which defines how bodies interact through
//! their sites. The properties of the sites *in the system frame* are a function
//! of the body's properties and the site properties *in the body frame*. In a
//! particle-only simulation model each body has one site at the origin in the body
//! frame. In a simulation of squares, each body might be made up of four sites on
//! the vertices. In both cases, the net force on the body is the sum of the forces
//! applied to all of its sites.
//!
//! In [`Microstate`], the body properties (the generic type `B` throughout) and the
//! site properties (the generic type `S`) do not need to be the same. For example,
//! a body might have mass, position and velocity while that body's sites have
//! position and type.
//!
//! The [`property`] module provides a number of property types. It also defines
//! traits that you can use to implement custom property types. At a minimum, *both
//! `B` and `S` MUST implement [`property::Position`]* so that [`Microstate`] can
//! place your body's and sites inside the boundary conditions and maintain spatial
//! data structures. Some interaction models (such as shape overlap energies) will
//! require other traits (such as [`property::Orientation`]). Molecular dynamics
//! simulations operate on bodies with either a [`property::DynamicPoint`] or
//! [`property::DynamicOrientedPoint`] type. The [`property`] module
//! documentation provides more details on using the types it provides and how to
//! define custom types.
//!
//! [`Microstate::add_body`] and [`Microstate::extend_bodies`] add new bodies (and
//! their sites) to the microstate. Similarly, [`Microstate::remove_body`] removes a
//! body (and all associated sites). [`Microstate::update_body_properties`] modifies
//! the properties of a given body and correspondingly the properties of all sites
//! associated with that body. All these methods have a cost proportional to the
//! number of sites in the body.
//!
//! [`Microstate::bodies`] provides direct (immutable) access to the bodies in
//! the microstate, including their properties and sites in the body frame. While
//! some algorithms may find this useful, many model algorithms instead operate
//! on site properties in the system frame. [`Microstate::sites`] provides direct
//! (immutable) access to a slice of all sites in the system frame for this
//! purpose. Any method that adds, removes, or changes a body immediately updates
//! [`Microstate::sites`] accordingly. [`Microstate::iter_body_sites`] iterates over
//! all the sites (in the system frame) associated with a given body.
//!
//! ## Tags
//!
//! The elements of [`Microstate::bodies`] and [`Microstate::sites`] are stored in
//! **no particular order** to allow efficient addition and removal of bodies and
//! for the possibility sorting to improve cache coherency. Callers are welcome
//! to iterate over these data structures when computing order-independent overall
//! properties. However, a caller should never maintain indices into these vectors.
//! Instead, the caller should store the appropriate **tag** when it needs to
//! persistently refer to a specific body or site.
//!
//! Elements in [`Microstate::bodies`] have the type [`Tagged<Body>`].
//! The [`item`](Tagged::item) field holds the body itself while the
//! [`tag`](Tagged::tag) field is a unique identifier that identifies this
//! specific body. The tag will remain the same even when [`Microstate::bodies`] is
//! reordered. Use [`Microstate::body_indices`] to find the current index of a body
//! with a given tag.
//!
//! Elements in [`Microstate::sites`] have the type [`Site<S>`]. As with bodies,
//! each site has a unique [`site_tag`](Site::site_tag) that remains the same even
//! when sites are reordered. Each site also has a [`body_tag`](Site::body_tag) that
//! identifies which body the site is part of. Use [`Microstate::site_indices`]
//! to find the current index of a site with a given site tag and
//! [`Microstate::iter_body_sites`] to find all the sites associated with a given
//! body *index*.
//!
//! ## Boundary conditions
//!
//! The positions of all bodies and all sites **must** be inside the microstate's
//! boundary at all times. Periodic boundaries can wrap positions outside to a
//! corresponding point on the inside. When a boundary is aperiodic (or partially
//! aperiodic), the wrapping process may fail. MC models reject trial moves that
//! cannot be wrapped. MD models fail with an error should bodies or sites move in a
//! way that cannot be wrapped.
//!
//! [`Microstate`] is generic on the type of boundary condition. The [`boundary`]
//! module implements standard types and explains how you can provide custom
//! implementations.
//!
//! ## Spatial searches
//!
//! `Microstate` maintains a internal spatial data structure (see [`hoomd_spatial`]).
//! It is kept in sync with every body insertion, removal, and update. Callers
//! can query the spatial data directly with [`spatial_data`] and efficiently iterate
//! over all sites near a point in space with [`iter_sites_near`].
//!
//! [`spatial_data`]: Microstate::spatial_data
//! [`iter_sites_near`]: Microstate::iter_sites_near
//!
//! ## Ghost sites
//!
//! Periodic boundary conditions place **ghost sites** within a given **maximum
//! interaction range** outside the boundary. These ghost sites are images of real
//! sites that are inside the boundary. Access all of the ghosts with the
//! [`ghosts`] method. [`iter_sites_near`] will find both primary and ghost sites
//! as it searches for sites near the requested point.
//!
//! When using [`Open`] or [`Closed`] boundary conditions, [`ghosts`] will always
//! be empty.
//!
//! [`ghosts`]: Microstate::ghosts
//! [`Open`]: crate::boundary::Open
//! [`Closed`]: crate::boundary::Closed
//!
//! ## I/O
//!
//! Use [`HoomdGsdFile`] and [`AppendMicrostate`] to write to GSD
//! files that can be read by the [Ovito], [HOOMD-blue],
//! the [GSD Python package], and other applications. There is currently no
//! high-level API to *read* a GSD file and produce a [`Microstate`]. You can
//! implement your own solution using the low level [`GsdFile`].
//!
//! [`GsdFile`]: hoomd_gsd::file_layer::GsdFile

//! [Ovito]: https://www.ovito.org
//!
//! [`Microstate`] derives the [serde] `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits,
//! along with all other types in *hoomd-rs*. You can use [serde] to read and
//! write entire `Simulation` models. Use [serde] serialized files (in a
//! format of your choice, [postcard] is a good starting point) to save the
//! simulation state and continue running where it left off. The format is *NOT*
//! well-defined for long-term use. It **will** change from one simulation model
//! to the next, and *may* change with each major release of *hoomd-rs*. Share
//! your simulation **code** along with GSD **data** with the community.
