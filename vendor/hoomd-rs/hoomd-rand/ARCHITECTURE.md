## Random Number Generator Basics

At their most basic, pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs, often shortened to RNGs)
allow for the generation of streams of data that closely resemble random numbers. While
the numbers are not truly random, the statistics of good PRNGs are indistinguishable
from true randomness and the outputs can be made deterministic, an extremely valuable
feature for reproducibility. While encryption algorithms use "cryptographically secure"
random number streams (those whose input cannot be reverse-engineered from the output),
simulations can utilize non-cryptographic PRNGs without impacting correctness.
Intuitively, cryptographic security prevents the design of targeted, structured attacks
which do not resemble the random processes we explore in simulation. Good PRNGs --
including those included in this crate -- are carefully validated to ensure output
streams are uncorrelated and have a sufficiently long period. In most cases, a minimum
period length is enforced by a 64-bit counter that prevents streams from colliding
(sharing regions of PRNG state space) for at least $`2^{64}`$ generated values.

## SFC64 and alternative PRNGs

The default PRNG in hoomd-rs is `SFC64`, a chaotic PRNG with a 256-bit state. The
"chaotic" nature indicates the presence of multiple, disconnected cycles through subsets
of the full state space. While it is not tractable to precisely quantify features of
this PRNG, we can provably guarantee that the shortest cycle of `SFC64` is $`2^{67}`$
bytes, and the expected cycle length is much larger at $`2^{258}`$ bytes. This means
that each of the $`2^{192}`$ 24-byte seeds can generate at least an exabyte of data
before colliding with another stream. Users can refer to
[Melissa O'Neill's discussion](https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/random-invertible-mapping-statistics.html)
of chaotic-type PRNGs for further details.

`SFC64` was selected as the fastest portable PRNG we tested, although the `AESRand` PRNG
is faster on systems that have hardware AES instructions. This is also a chaotic-type
PRNG, but uses AES encode and decode to form a random invertible mapping rather than
standard operations like addition or xor. For users who require extreme volumes of
random data, `AESRand` might be valuable -- however, the 128-bit state limits its use in
parallel contexts where large numbers of independent streams are required.

The `extras` feature of this crate also includes the classic
[`ThreeFry2x64`](https://random123.com) PRNG, which has excellent statistics but
orders-of-magnitude worse performance than `SFC64` and `AESRand`. Many other PRNGs were
tested for this crate, but `SFC64` and `AESRand` are recommended as all other options
sacrifice either performance or statistical quality.

## Seeds and counters

Like HOOMD-blue, hoomd-rs will use a counter based random number generator to provide
reproducible results, consistent performance, and support for parallel execution. The
`hoomd_rand` module provides a unified API so that other parts of hoomd-rs can
consistently initialize counter-based RNG types without overlaps.

Based on the usage in HOOMD-blue, methods will need a way to create RNGs with a fixed
seed layout that includes the timestep, substep, and user seed. HOOMD-blue uses 1 to 3
counter values to generate unique random numbers along with that seed. Those values may
be particle tags, chain ids, MPI ranks, etc... The caller chooses whatever is needed for
its algorithm.

The `SFC64` PRNG provides 24 bytes of seed data which can be set based on the simulation
step, substep, and random seed, alongside an additional 8-byte index for simple access
to uncorrelated parallel streams.
