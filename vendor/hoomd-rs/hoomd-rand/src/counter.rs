/// Conveniently construct counter based random number generators.
///
/// Counter based random number generators produce a stream of random numbers
/// that is a reproducible function of a counter value. They are efficient to
/// use, even when only one or a few random numbers are needed. [`Counter`]
/// allows callers to conveniently construct RNGS that are independent, as well
/// as ones that produce identical values.
///
/// There are 3 required elements of each counter.
/// * `step` (8 bytes) is the current simulation step and ensures that random
///   number streams are not correlated from one simulation step to the next.
/// * `substep` (4 bytes) similarly ensures that different parts of the
///   algorithm that advance the simulation are not correlated within a single
///   step.
/// * `seed` (4 bytes) is a value that allows users to execute replicate
///   simulations that are identical except for the random numbers applied.
///
/// There is an additional 8-byte index. Generally, many simulation algorithms
/// will set this to particle indices so that RNG streams are independent from
/// one particle (or pair of particles) to the next. The [`indices`] method
/// treats the index as two 4-byte indices. To generate the same random numbers
/// (e.g. for use in a DPD thermostat) in independent threads, set the first
/// index to `min(i,j)` and the second to `max(i,j)`.
///
/// [`indices`]: Self::indices
///
/// # Performance
///
/// The current implementation uses [`SFC64`], which generates
/// one 64-bit word at at time. Benchmarks show that executing
/// `Counter.new(...).make_rng()` and sampling values that fall in the first
/// batch runs at approximately 100 million operations per second (run `cargo
/// bench` to see the measured performance on your architecture).
