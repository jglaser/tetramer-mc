//! Graphical elements that depict the simulation microstate.
//!
//! The `representation` module contains types that you can use to visually represent
//! your sites, bodies, or calculated properties of the simulation state. Each type
//! has implementation dependent details, although most include a `setup` method
//! that you need to add to the `Startup` schedule and helper methods that you can call
//! in the `Update` schedule to synchronize the state.
//!
//! Most of the types in `representation` are opaque primitives intended to
//! represent sites or bodies. Some, such as those ending in `Boundary` are thin
//! outlines intended to represent the simulation boundaries.
