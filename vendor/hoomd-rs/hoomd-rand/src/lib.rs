//! Provides a collection of fast, high-quality random number generators (RNGs) for the HOOMD ecosystem.
//!
//! This crate offers implementations of several modern RNG algorithms, including:
//!
//! - [`SFC64`]: The "Small Fast Chaotic" counter based RNG, which should used by default
//!   in most cases. It is extremely fast, has low latency, and is very
//!   statistically sound -- we have validated that streams are independent and
//!   uncorrelated for >2TB of data per seed.
//! - `AESRand`: An AES-based RNG (currently only available on some aarch64
//!   platforms). This can be even faster than SFC64, but has a smaller state that
//!   makes it less suitable for highly parallel applications.
//!
