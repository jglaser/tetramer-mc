//! Traits that describe system macrostates and types that implement them.
//!
//! ## Macrostate
//!
//! Use a built-in macrostate type, such as [`Isothermal`], [`IsothermalIsobaric`]
//! or [`Isobaric`] store the temperature and/or pressure set points for use
//! with thermostats, barostats, and/or Monte Carlo trial moves:
//!
//! ```
//! use hoomd_simulation::macrostate::Isothermal;
//!
//! let macrostate = Isothermal { temperature: 1.2 };
//! ```
//!
//! The *actual* ensemble that your simulation samples is set by the methods
//! that you apply to it. These macrostate types exist merely to pass
//! parameters to methods that need them. For example, you could choose an
//! [`IsothermalIsobaric`] macrostate and use it only with local Monte Carlo
//! moves. Without boundary moves, the simulation will be in the NVT ensemble.
//!
//! ## Traits
//!
//! When you need additional macrostate parameters, use a custom type.
//! Implement [`Temperature`] and/or [`Pressure`] for your type as needed.
