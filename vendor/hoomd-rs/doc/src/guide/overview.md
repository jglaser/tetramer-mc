# Overview

*hoomd-rs* is not an application that you install and use. It is a coupled
set of [Rust] *crates*. Each individual crate serves a narrow purpose and,
to the extent possible, is usable on its own without the others.
The collection as a whole enables Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics
simulations of soft matter systems.

To use *hoomd-rs*, you need to write a [Rust] application that links to
one or more *hoomd-rs* crates. What you do in your application is completely
up to you. You can learn about what each crate does in its documentation.

## Interaction models

[hoomd-interaction] implements many interaction models commonly used
in soft matter research, such as the Lennard-Jones pair,
linear external, and hard shape overlap potentials. When you need something
different, implement your own interaction model via one or more of the
traits defined in [hoomd-interaction].

See the [hoomd-interaction] documentation for a more detailed introduction,
a complete list of all interaction models, and example code.

## Representing shapes

[hoomd-geometry] defines many common 2D and 3D shapes and implements a number
of operations on them. You can use these shapes to define your simulation boundary
and site interactions. When you need a different class of shape,
implement your own via one or more of the traits defined in [hoomd-geometry].

See the [hoomd-geometry] documentation for a more detailed introduction,
a complete list of all shapes, and example code.

## Tracking the system's microstate

[hoomd-microstate] defines the `Microstate` type which tracks all the degrees of
freedom for the *bodies* in your simulation and provides efficient methods to
access their *sites*. Many of the [hoomd-interaction] traits operate on a
system microstate, such as `TotalEnergy` which computes the total energy of
a microstate for a given interaction model.

See the [hoomd-microstate] documentation for a more detailed introduction,
a complete list of all methods, and example code.

## Monte Carlo (MC) simulations

[hoomd-mc] implements typical Monte Carlo trial moves used in soft matter
research, such as local translation and rotation moves. Each trial move is
applied to a `Microstate` ([hoomd-microstate]) and accepted or rejected based on
the given interaction model ([hoomd-interaction]). When you need a different type
of trial move for your simulation model, implement your own via one or more of the
traits defined in [hoomd-mc].

## Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations

[hoomd-md] implements methods that integrate the translational and/or rotational
degrees of freedom in the `Microstate` forward in time. Bodies move in response
to forces and torques determined by the interaction model ([hoomd-interaction]),
the chosen integration method, and thermostat. The MD and interaction models are
the same. Provided that the interaction is differentiable, you can freely swap
between MD integration and MC trial moves in the same simulation.

## Writing GSD files

Use [hoomd-gsd] to read and write GSD files that store the position and orientation
of the sites in your microstate as a function of time. Use GSD files for offline
analysis and visualization after your simulation job completes.

## Integrate hoomd-rs with your workflow

Use the [hoomd-workspace] crate to read and write jobs in [signac] workspaces.
Write commands in [Rust] that initialize, equilibrate, sample, and analyze
models. Submit and track the progress of thousands of individual simulation
runs using [row].
